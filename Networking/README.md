# Networking 

## 5 layer model/Tcp-ip

1) The physical layer

Physical devices of the computer that interconnect computers - etc  specifications, cables

2) Datalink layer/network access layer

Responsible for defining a common way of interpreting these signals so network devices can communicate - eg, ethernet standard define a protocol for getting data to nodes on the same network or link

3) Network Layer/internet layer

Allows different networks to communicate with each other through devices known as routers. An internetwork is a collection of networks connected together through routers, for example the internet. Responsible for getting data delivered across a collection of network. Protocol used - IP/internet protocol

4) Transport layer

Sorts out which client and server programs are supposed to get that data. Protocls on this layer include TCP and UDP. TCP has instructions that ensures data is reliably delivered while UDP does not.

5) Application layer

Applications. Protocols include HTTP, for example.

## Cables

Copper - Cat 5, 5e, 6 cables. Cat 5e and 6 have more stringent requirements and reduce cross talk.
Fibre - use light to represent binary data

## Routers

Router is a device that can forward data between independent network. Operates at layer 3.

## Servers abd client

What it is called depends on its purpose of existance.

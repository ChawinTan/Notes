# SVG tutorials

## About

SVG stands for scalable vector graphic. It differs from typical raster images in that it is determined by math and not limited by the number of pixels it has. Thus, when you zoom in on an svg image, the images scale accordingly and you don't see the pixels in the image.

## Viewport

Viewport is the size of the window (what i can see physically on the screen). Setting the width and height of the svg is essentially determining the size of the viewport. Setting the radius, for example is determining where your viewport is looking at.

## ViewBox

Viewbox controls what is inside the viewport. First 2 numbers of viewBox determines the starting coordinate of the viewport. Second 2 numbers determine how many units you want to squeeze into the box (that has a height and width set). Its sort of acts like a zoom.

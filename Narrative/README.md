# How to write a good narrative, Jeff bezos style

A narrative is a document that can be used for planning, solutioning, proposal and reflection purposes. Its intent is to try to lay out the connection between facts and ideas as clearly as possible, providing more depth to the underlying connections rather than glossing over bullet points.

## Structure

1. Purpose
